# Advanced_Bird_Classification
Birds are a really important part of our huge ecosystem and are constantly facing survival challenges to adapt the constant changes our planet is facing including pollution , global warming etc. Many species are depleting because of human negligence towards them.

Small step can make huge effects in future. We believe only way to save these animals is to start sensitizing people around us about them . Then only constructively we,as a community, will be able to help them coexist and flourish. And whats the better way to sensitize people than about telling them about beautiful birds around them.

In day to day life we see or hear sound of various birds around us but because of busy life schedule we are not able to know about them. So tried to bridge this gap between us and nature. Knowing the species of the bird can tell a lot about it. It can be the first step in many cases to spark the interest in someone.

We developed an app which can find the species of bird using their sound/images and encourage one to read more about it. 
App is a simple easy to use interface which uses machine learning algorithm deployed on remote server to detect and classify bird species using their image and sound.
